# Weather App 🌤️

A sleek and simple weather application built with [your stack – e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript / React / etc.]. It lets users check current weather conditions by city, complete with temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more!

🔧 Features

- Fetch current weather by city name.
- Display key data: temperature, humidity, wind speed, visibility.
- Contextual weather icon or background based on conditions.
- Error handling for city not found or API issues.
- (Optional) Geolocation support – show weather for user’s current location.

🚀 Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jishnubrata/Weather_app.git
   cd Weather_app
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Obtain an API key:**

   - Sign up at OpenWeatherMap (or your chosen API).

📁 Project Structure

```bash
Weather_app/
├── index.html       # Main UI
├── style.css        # Styles
└── script.js        # Fetch logic & DOM handling
```
**🚦 Usage**
  1. Type a city name into the search box.

  2. Press Enter or click the search button.

  3. View real‑time weather details.

  4. Receive feedback if the city is not found or an error occurs.

**🔄 How it Works**

  1. The app listens for user input and fires a Fetch request to OpenWeatherMap.

  2. Converts the JSON response to display core weather data.

  3. Selects a matching weather icon or background based on the returned conditions.

**🛎️ Error Handling**

Alerts the user if:

 1. The city name is invalid or not found.

 2. Network/API errors occur.

**🌐 Acknowledgements**
This project draws inspiration from various weather apps leveraging OpenWeatherMap—many implement features like displaying temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather icons

**📈 Future Improvements**

  1. Add a 7‑day forecast view.

  2. Enable auto‑location lookup using Geolocation API.

  3. Enhance UI with animations (e.g., sunrise/sunset, background transitions).

  4. Allow toggling between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
